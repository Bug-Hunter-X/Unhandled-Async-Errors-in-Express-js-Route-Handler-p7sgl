# Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous route handlers.  Asynchronous operations (like database queries, file I/O, or external API calls) can throw errors, and if not properly handled, these errors can cause the server to crash or silently fail.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express.js route handler that doesn't handle errors thrown by an asynchronous operation. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Observe that the server might crash or fail silently if the asynchronous operation throws an error.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`. Observe that the server now gracefully handles errors and responds appropriately.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `catch` block to the `then()` chain of the asynchronous operation to handle potential errors.  The `catch` block should log the error and send a meaningful error response to the client.  For production applications, consider using a more robust error-handling strategy (e.g., centralized error logging, custom error responses, monitoring tools).
